# TBM_7dmod
Tunnel Boring Machine mod for 7 days to die 21.2



# Download the right stuff for your version
I started with Max Fox tutorial on Youtube for 7days version 21, 
if you are at a newer version.... maybe Max FOx has a vid for that :shrug:

Download the template for v21:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc0Fvl6e5a0&ab_channel=MaxFox

Go to your 7days folder, for me its:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\

Create folder
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

Download the template somewhere and extract it to there:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\modding-template-a21-main


# Ok you have the template for a mod 
Edit the Meta XML for this mod:
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\modding-template-a21-main\ModletTemplateA21\ModInfo.xml


# Set a good name for your mod
Explorer to  D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods
Rename this modding-template-a21-main to whatever you want, "MyMod"
