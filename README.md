# TBM_7dmod
Tunnel Boring Machine mod for 7 days to die 21.2



# If 7days is newer version?
Download the right stuff for your version. I started with Max Fox tutorial on Youtube for 7days version 21, 
if you are at a newer version.... maybe Max Fox has a vid for that :shrug:



# Steps I followed to start this off
I downloaded the template for v21, linked in the description for video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc0Fvl6e5a0&ab_channel=MaxFox

Create folder in Your installation of 7days, for me i created the "Mods" folder in
D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\

I edited the Meta XML for this mod:
tbm-mod-a21\ModletTemplateA21\ModInfo.xml


# Unity...
For the 3d models, I used blender, I also used Unity to convert the 3dmodels from .OBJ to .unity3d object.
THe guide I followed is... Link please

Download Unity Hub, install the CORRECT version of Unity, I used 2021.3.5 first. then I tried 2021.3.36f1, lets see if that works/2024-03-14
